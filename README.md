# Scribe notes

Please upload your scribe notes here.

## Workflow

1. Clone this repo if you haven't already.

2. (Pull the repo if you have).

3. Open the `scribetemplate.tex`.

4. Immediately "Save as": `lecture[a].tex` where you have replaced `[a]` with the appropriate number.

5. Type your notes. Make sure to take advantage of existing macros. Add any new references to the `.bib` file. Compile to pdf as usual.

6. Push your new notes to the repo within 1 week of the lecture. I will make edits as necessary.
